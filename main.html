        <p>(Welcome to our Basketball Scoring System! + "\n";

         1. To begin, you will see an 'input teams' page- here, simply enter 'Team 1s' name in the field below 'Team 1'. "\n";

         2. Next, enter the first players number on Team 1, in the field marked below 'Number' + "\n";

         3. Next, enter player 1s first and last name to the right of the number field- marked 'First and Last Name'
         4. After you have implemented these fields, click on the arrow marked: 'Ë¯'- downward arrow, which will allow you to enter the second players credentials 
         5. Repeat this same procedure for the other 5 players participating on Team 1.
         6. After team 1 has been complete, repeat this same procedure for Team 2, by first entering the Team's name.
         7. After this procedure is complete, and all 10 players' credentials have been implemented, click on the button labelled 'Let's go!'
         Congratulations! you have successfully inputted the Team name, player numbers, and their names!
         As you can see, this next page includes, the countdown timer, scoreboard and log table. 

         1. Once you are ready to begin, first click the button labelled 'reset' under the timer, to ensure the time is set for the first half- 20:00mins + "\n";
         2. Click the button labelled: 'start' to commence the 20 minute countdown- this indicates the first half has started!
         3. As the countdown begins, be aware that if a player scores, you will be required to input the points on the scoreboard.
         4. For example, player '2' on team 1 has just scored two points. 
         5. In order to reflect this on the scoreboard, locate the tab, which in this example is: 'team 1' 
         6. Below the tab, you will find: [blank box] scored [blank box] points [enter] 
         7. In the first blank box, to the left of 'scored', enter the number of the player who just scored.
         8. After inputted, find the next blank box on the line, to the right of 'scored' and record how many points the player scored (e.g. 2)
         9. Once the boxes are filled, simply press the 'enter' button to the right of 'points', once clicked, the points will display on the scoreboard. 
         10. If for instance, player 4 on team 2, fouled player 1 on team 1, you will need to record and project this on the scoreboard. 
         11. To record this foul, locate the tab, which in this example is: 'team 2'
         12. Two rows below this tab, you will find: [blank box] fouled opposition [blank box] [enter]
         13. In the first [blank box] to the left of 'fouled opposition', enter the number of the player who committed the foul (e.g. player 4 on team 2)
         14. Once the first [blank box] is filled, go to the second [blank box] to the right of 'fouled opposition' and input the player's number on team 1, who was fouled (e.g. player 1)
         15. Once completed, click on the 'enter' button, and the foul(s) should be displayed on the scoreboard 
         16. If a time out is required, simply click the button labelled '+ time out', located in the button row- once clicked, this will display on the scoreboard, next to 'Time outs'
         17. Once the half has finished, as indicated by the countdown, simply click, 'stop' then 'reset' to prepare the countdown for the second half
         18. Repeat the above steps/procedures from the first half, when required. 
         19. Finally, when the second half has concluded, yet again, indicated by the countdown, simply click the 'Start new game' button to then be taken back to the input teams page. 
         20. Repeat these same steps for the next game!)</p>
